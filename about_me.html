									<p>
										Prabowo Setiawan is a data science enthusiast who is currently working as a Data Engineer and Analyst at a Fintech company. Prabowo received his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stony Brook University (2018) then continued his pursuit of a graduate degree to University of Leeds (2019) in Advanced Mechanical Engineering. Ever since he was studying in university, Prabowo had shown interest in research, especially ones involved with computational engineering.
									</p>
									<p>
										Prabowo had several experiences in being an undergraduate research assistant, one of which was developing an equation of motions for a multiple link biped system through the use of Lagrange methods implemented in MATLAB. This was his first experience combining a substantial amount of knowledge from engineering dynamics and computer science. This only led to Prabowo's growing interest in learning programming to achieve heavy computational tasks. 
										In addition, Prabowo also took the role of simulating Finite Element Analysis and Computational Fluid Dynamics for the launch vehicle his team designed during NASA Student Launch competition in 2018. Finally, he decided to model a launch vehicle dynamics control system assisted by a simple neural network for his Masters' project, a turning point in which Prabowo realized he wanted to discover more of artificial intelligence and its application in many facets of this world.
									</p>
									<p>
										Prabowo had a brief experience as a Data Scientist in which he developed a Monte Carlo simulation of liquidity management for a government's public housing agency. He then proceeded to explore the role of Data Engineer at a Fintech company, where he oversees the Data Science team's data warehouse models. Now that Prabowo has a better grasp of understanding of data science's application and impacts, he is currently seeking experience in which he could explore both aspects of research and data science to deliver impact to the society.
